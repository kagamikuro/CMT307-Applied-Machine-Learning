Outline Description of Module:
The field of machine learning is concerned with the study of methods for developing computer programs that are able to learn from examples or from prior experience. Machine learning lies at the basis of many of the recent successes in artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to digital assistants and search engines. This module will serve as a general introduction to machine learning, covering both traditional methods such as decision trees and support vector machines and more recent neural network based techniques. Although the module will also cover the core principles behind these methods, the main focus will be on application oriented aspects of machine leaning, such as how to implement key machine learning techniques, how to choose which technique to use in a given situation, how to pre-process data, and how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning system. In addition to these technical topics, the module will also cover some important ethical considerations, including how the choice of training data can introduce unwanted biases in real-world applications.

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
Implement and evaluate machine learning methods to solve a given task
Explain the basic principles underlying common machine learning methods
Choose an appropriate machine learning method and data pre-processing strategy to address the needs of a given application setting
Reflect on the importance of data representation for the success of machine learning methods
Critically appraise the ethical implications and societal risks associated with the deployment of machine learning methods
Explain the nature, strengths and limitations of an implemented machine learning technique to an audience of non-specialists
How the module will be delivered:
This module will use a combination of lectures and labs. The lectures will be used to teach the main principles and to prepare and review the lab assignments. During the weekly labs, the students will be able to put these principles into practice, e.g. by implementing a method from scratch or by evaluating the performance and limitations of a given method.

Skills that will be practised and developed:
Implementing machine learning tools, taking advantage of existing libraries where appropriate

Assessing the potential and limitations of machine learning technology

Presenting a technical subject matter to an audience of non-specialists

Critically thinking about which tools are appropriate in what contexts, and what are the possible ethical, social or economical implications

Formalising real-world problems in a rigorous way 

How the module will be assessed:
The module will be assessed by two pieces of coursework.

The first coursework will require the student to choose and justify a machine learning method for solving a given problem. They will need to implement a suitable data pre-processing strategy and carry out a detailed evaluation of the performance of their system. A written report with their findings will need to be submitted. This coursework will assess learning outcomes 1,2,3,4.

The second coursework will require the student to design and implement a neural network model for a given problem. They will need to evaluate this method and report their findings in an oral presentation. This presentation will also need to include an appraisal of the ethical considerations that would be associated with deploying the implemented method. This coursework will assess learning outcomes 1,3,5,6.

Students will be provided with reassessment opportunities in line with University regulations.
